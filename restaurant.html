                <h2>Our <span class="text-warning">Trippy</span> Story</h2>
                    <p>One day, long ago, the founder of Trippy Taco was lost in the desert.
                    He only had 3 tortillas but nothing to put in them, until he found a catcus!
                    Not knowing what this plant was he decided to put in in between his tortillas and
                    have his lunch. A few moments later, he realized something was different...he realized
                    he had eaten Peyote!!! The entire day the desert transformed colors, things did not look
                    the same. He followed bright lights until he found a small town and found safety once again.
                    That day he decided he was going to open Trippy Taco!
