This was a fun little excercise I did where I created a fake restaurant website homepage. This wouldn't be something I would want to build for a client but let me show off some of the skills I could do with JavaScript and JQuery. The website alerts when the page has loaded, then changes the background and slides the website up and down. I change the styling of the first paragraph and fade a picture in and out. I also created an accordion animation style menu...again this wouldn't be of use for a client but was a fun excercise to flext my JavaScript and JQuery skills in a fun way.
